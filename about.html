          <h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>As you have probably deduced from my homepage title, my name is Wesley Pickering, however, I also go by Wes, because that means
					I'm less likely to screw up my name when introducing myself. I am currently a 3rd year computer
					science major at Univerity of California, Berkeley with an interest in software engineering and video game programming.
					My hobbies include soccer, video games, board games, making terrible puns (I really had to refrain from putting some in this bio),
					cooking, and reading. In addition to classes, I play soccer for the Berkeley Men's Club Team. When I am not doing anything for either
					of those commitments, you can find me rewatching Game of Thrones, rereading books by Brandon Sanderson, forcing myself not to play MOBAs or MMORPGs, and
					watching a considerable amount of League of Legends and Overwatch.
